| ingress.host | string | `nil` | The fully-qualified hostname of the Ingress. |
| ingress.https | bool | `true` | True if the browser communicates with the application over HTTPS. |
| ingress.nginx | bool | `true` | True if the created Ingress is to use the Kubernetes ingress-nginx controller. This will populate the Ingress with annotations for that controller. Set to false if a different controller is to be used, in which case the annotations need to be specified. |

| podAnnotations | object | `{}` | Specify additional annotations to be added to all Crowd pods |
| replicaCount | int | `1` | The initial number of pods that should be started at deployment of each of Crowd. Note that because Crowd requires initial manual configuration after the first pod is deployed, and before scaling up to additional pods, this should always be kept as 1. |
| serviceAccount.clusterRole.create | bool | `true` | true if a ClusterRole should be created, or false if it already exists |
| serviceAccount.clusterRole.name | string | `nil` | Specifies the name of the ClusterRole that will be created if the "serviceAccount.clusterRole.create" flag is set. If not specified, a name will be auto-generated. |

| tolerations | list | `[]` | Standard Kubernetes tolerations that will be applied to all Crowd pods |
| volumes.additional | list | `[]` | Defines additional volumes that should be applied to all Crowd pods. Note that this will not create any corresponding volume mounts; those needs to be defined in crowd.additionalVolumeMounts |
| volumes.localHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | When persistentVolumeClaim.create is false, then this value can be used to define a standard Kubernetes volume which will be used for the local-home volumes. If not defined, then defaults to an emptyDir volume. |
| volumes.localHome.mountPath | string | `"/var/atlassian/application-data/crowd"` |  |
| volumes.localHome.persistentVolumeClaim.create | bool | `false` | If true, then a PersistentVolumeClaim will be created for each local-home volume. |

| volumes.localHome.persistentVolumeClaim.storageClassName | string | `nil` | Specifies the name of the storage class that should be used for the local-home volume claim. |
| volumes.sharedHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | When persistentVolumeClaim.create is false, then this value can be used to define a standard Kubernetes volume which will be used for the shared-home volume. If not defined, then defaults to an emptyDir (i.e. unshared) volume. |

| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.command | string | `nil` | By default, the fixer will change the group ownership of the volume's root directory to match the Crowd container's GID (2002), and then ensures the directory is group-writeable. If this is not the desired behaviour, command used can be specified here. |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.enabled | bool | `false` | If enabled, this will alter the shared-home volume's root directory so that Crowd can write to it. This is a workaround for a Kubernetes bug affecting NFS volumes: https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/issues/260 |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.mountPath | string | `"/shared-home"` | The path in the initContainer where the shared-home volume will be mounted |
